# etude-s-plane

Just as the title says, this is an exercise(look up 'etude' and you'll know what does it mean), and 's-plane' means the complex plane.

In brief, we have a `f(z)` in the `main.cc`, which represents a complex function, and `out.png`(use `make out.png` to get it, and you should have `ffmpeg` installed) shows what this function looks like. For example, the image of `f(z) = log(z)` is shown as below:

![Image of f(z) = log z around the origin, indicating that log(z) is not analytic on the nagative real axis or the origin.](logz.png "Image of f(z) = log(z) around the origin")

We'll not go any further into details because it is pretty easy for the program to be understood.
