# etude-s-plane

Just as the title says, this is an exercise(you can look up 'etude' and you'll know what does it mean), and 's-plane' means the complex plane.

In brief, we have a `f(z)` in the `main.cc`, which represent a complex function, and `out.png`(use `make out.png` to get it, and you should have `ffmpeg` installed) shows how this function looks like. For example, the image of `f(z) = log(z)` is shown below:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="logz.png" alt="Image of f(z) = log z, indicating that log(z) is not analytic on the nagative real axis and the origin." style="width: 240px; height: 240px; align: center;"/></div>

I'll not go any further into the details because I wrote this just for fun, and it is pretty easy to be understood.
